NAME
       self_cmd - CLI shell scripting for lazy people

SYNOPSIS
       self_cmd [--help ] [--version ] [--baz POO CAT] FOO BAR

DESCRIPTION
       A  skeletal  wireframe  to  speed  development of command-line interface (CLI) executable bash scripts. Intended to speed coding for more than the simplest command-line
       scripts. Use whenever 'optargs' isn't enough, or when the number of parameters is too unwieldy for positional arguments, or when one doesn't feel like doing  CLI  argu‐
       ment parsing, at all.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              print help message and exit

       -v --version
              print version and exit

       -b --baz POO CAT
              optional: baz POO CAT

FILES
       The 'skel' command copies files in './skel' directory (or the current scripts) to the given destination path, renaming them in the process.

EXIT STATUS
       Exits with status $NOERR (0 for OK, and >0 with errors).

EXAMPLES
       self_cmd skel /path/to/new/script

       self_cmd fling -t -p poo \"Phil Collins\" \"Batman and Robin\"

BUGS
       Quotes must be escaped for multiple word arguments. Only double quotes are supported.
