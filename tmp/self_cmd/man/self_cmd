.SH NAME
self_cmd \- CLI shell scripting for lazy people
.SH SYNOPSIS
self_cmd [--help ] [--version ] [--baz POO CAT] FOO BAR
.SH DESCRIPTION
A skeletal wireframe to speed development of command-line interface (CLI) executable bash scripts. Intended to speed coding for more than the simplest command-line scripts. Use whenever 'optargs' isn't enough, or when the number of parameters is too unwieldy for positional arguments, or when one doesn't feel like doing CLI argument parsing, at all.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-h --help"
print help message and exit
.IP "-v --version"
print version and exit
.IP "-b --baz POO CAT"
optional: baz POO CAT
.SH FILES
The 'skel' command copies files in './skel' directory (or the current scripts) to the given destination path, renaming them in the process.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Exits with status $NOERR (0 for OK, and >0 with errors).
.SH EXAMPLES
\&self_cmd skel /path/to/new/script

\&self_cmd fling -t -p poo \(rs"Phil Collins\(rs" \(rs"Batman and Robin\(rs"
.SH BUGS
Quotes must be escaped for multiple word arguments. Only double quotes are supported.
