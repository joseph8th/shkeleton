.SH DESCRIPTION
A skeletal wireframe to speed development of command-line interface (CLI) executable bash scripts. Intended to speed coding for more than the simplest command-line scripts. Use whenever 'optargs' isn't enough, or when the number of parameters is too unwieldy for positional arguments, or when one doesn't feel like doing CLI argument parsing, at all.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-h --help"
print help message
.SH COMMANDS
.IP "skel DEST"
copy './skel' to DEST, where DEST is a new directory
.IP "fling SRC DEST"
fling love from SRC at DEST
.SH fling:
.IP "-p --poo POO BAH"
SRC instead flings POO at DEST
.IP "-t --toss "
SRC instead tosses at DEST
.SH FILES
The 'skel' command copies files in './skel' directory (or the current scripts) to the given destination path, renaming them in the process.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Exits with status $NOERR (0 for OK, and >0 with errors).
