] COMMAND [OPTS] [ARGS] A skeletal wireframe to speed development
of command‐line interface (CLI) executable bash scripts. Intended
to  speed coding for more than the simplest command‐line scripts.
Use whenever ’optargs’ isn’t enough, or when the number of param‐
eters  is  too  unwieldy  for  positional  arguments, or when one
doesn’t feel like doing CLI argument parsing, at all.  print help
message  copy  ’./skel’  to  DEST,  where DEST is a new directory
fling love from SRC at DEST SRC instead flings POO  at  DEST  SRC
instead  tosses  at  DEST  The  ’skel’  command  copies  files in
’./skel’ directory (or the current scripts) to the given destina‐
tion  path, renaming them in the process.  Exits with status $NO‐
ERR  (0  for  OK,  and   >0   with   errors).    shkeleton   skel
